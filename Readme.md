# Global Metric Radar

A Python module to compute a composite **Global Score** from multiple metrics using radar chart geometry, with threshold-based penalties and weighted importance. Provides both numeric scores and human-readable interpretations.

## Features

‚úÖ Radar polygon area calculation to combine multiple metrics into a single geometric score.  
‚úÖ Customizable per-metric thresholds to flag metrics below minimum acceptable levels.  
‚úÖ Weighted penalties that reduce the global score based on the importance of failing metrics.  
‚úÖ Interpretation layer that classifies overall quality (`excellent`, `acceptable`, `poor`) with meaningful feedback.  
‚úÖ Interactive radar visualization with Streamlit.

## üìê How It Works: Step-by-Step Calculation

The **Global Metric Radar** computes an overall quality score by representing multiple normalized metrics as points on a radar chart and calculating the polygon area they form. This geometric approach allows capturing combined performance in a single scalar value.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Represent Metrics as Points on a Radar Chart

- For *n* metrics normalized to [0, 1], denoted:

  r = [r‚ÇÄ, r‚ÇÅ, ..., r‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ]

- Metrics are placed on evenly spaced axes around a radar chart.

- The angle between consecutive axes is:

  Œ∏ = 2œÄ / n

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Compute the Polygon Area Formed by Metrics

The area of the polygon formed by connecting metrics in order is calculated by:

Area = (1/2) √ó | Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÄ‚Åø‚Åª¬π  r·µ¢ √ó r_{(i+1) mod n} √ó sin(Œ∏) |

where:

- r·µ¢ is the metric on axis i,
- r_{(i+1) mod n} wraps around to form a closed shape,
- sin(Œ∏) accounts for the fixed angle between consecutive axes.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Normalize the Polygon Area

The maximum possible area, achieved when all metrics equal 1, is:

Max Area = (1/2) √ó n √ó sin(Œ∏)

The **normalized area** is given by:

Normalized Area = Area / Max Area

which ensures the result lies in [0, 1].

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Metrics Below Thresholds

Each metric is compared against its threshold. Metrics with:

r·µ¢ < threshold·µ¢

are recorded as failing.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Weighted Penalty

Metrics have importance weights w·µ¢. The penalty is calculated as:

- Total weight:

  W_total = Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÄ‚Åø‚Åª¬π w·µ¢

- Weight of failing metrics:

  W_bad = Œ£_{i ‚àà bad} w·µ¢

- Penalty factor:

  Penalty = 1 - (W_bad / W_total)

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Final Global Score

Combining geometry and penalty:

Global Score = Normalized Area √ó Penalty

This single score reflects both overall performance and the severity of failing metrics.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Human-Readable Interpretation

The `interpret_score()` function provides insights like:

- The number of metrics below thresholds.
- Penalty impact as percentage reduction from normalized area.
- Overall quality category:

  - ‚úÖ Excellent  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable with moderate issues  
  - ‚ùå Poor, critical improvements needed.

# API Reference

### `global_score(metrics, threshold=0.5, weights=None) -> (score, normalized_area, bad_metrics_indices)`

Calculate a weighted global quality score from a list of metrics.

#### Parameters:

- `metrics` (`list[float]` or `np.ndarray`): Metric values in the range [0, 1].
- `threshold` (`float` or `list[float]`, optional): Threshold(s) below which metrics are penalized. Default is `0.5`.
- `weights` (`list[float]` or `np.ndarray`, optional): Importance weights for each metric. Default is equal weights.

#### Returns:

- `score` (`float`): Final global score in [0, 1].
- `normalized_area` (`float`): Normalized radar polygon area representing combined metric performance.
- `bad_metrics_indices` (`list[int]`): Indices of metrics below their respective thresholds.

---

### `interpret_score(score, normalized_area, bad_metrics_indices, thresholds, metrics) -> str`

Generate a human-readable interpretation of the global score.

#### Parameters:

- `score` (`float`): Global score computed from `global_score`.
- `normalized_area` (`float`): Normalized radar area computed from `global_score`.
- `bad_metrics_indices` (`list[int]`): Indices of metrics below their thresholds.
- `thresholds` (`list[float]`): Threshold values per metric.
- `metrics` (`list[float]`): Original metric values.

#### Returns:

- `interpretation` (`str`): Text summary indicating quality level (`excellent`, `acceptable`, or `poor`), penalty impact, and metrics below threshold.
